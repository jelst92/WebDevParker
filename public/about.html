<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>From Teacher to Tech Builder:</h2>
<p>
  Greetings! My name is Joseph, and while I may spend my days guiding future computing whizzes, I'm also on a personal mission to become a web developer myself. You see, teaching web design principles is one thing, but the thrill of actually creating on the web is something else entirely.
  
 <h2>Beyond HTML Basics:</h2>
  
  <p>While my coding experience starts and ends with the HTML basics I teach 11-year-olds, my ambitions have loftier goals. I'm particularly fascinated by the potential of connecting websites to databases and building dynamic web applications. Think sleek login systems, user-friendly forms, and data flowing seamlessly – that's the magic I want to create.

  <h2>Learning for Lifelong Impact:</h2>
  
<p>  This website reflects my journey from coding novice to (hopefully!) confident developer. As a software developer in a school setting, I believe in continuous learning and pushing boundaries. Through this project, I'm diving into linking an SQL database to a website, building login systems, and mastering form submission – all skills I plan to bring back to my workplace and share with my students.
